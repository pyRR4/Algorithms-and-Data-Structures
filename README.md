# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
My second-term course in college


Every task was made in java.
It's important to point out that the unit tests aren't mine, but the teacher's who conducted the course.

The lists contains:
- List 1 - simple drawing algorithm
- List 2 - one way linked list with some additional operations carried out on them
- List 3 - two way linked list with some additional operations carried out on them
- List 4 - array stack and two way linked list based queue, with additional operations
- List 5 - simple sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort)
- List 6 - more advanced sorting algorithms (merge sort, radix sort)
- List 7 - HashMap
- List 8 - BST tree with a sorter based on it
- List 9 - disjoint forest set
- List 10 - graphs
- List 11 - more graphs
- List 12 - text matchers
- List 13 - convex hull
